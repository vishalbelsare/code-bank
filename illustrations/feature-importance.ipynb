    "In this example, we will compare the impurity-based feature importance of a random forest classifier with the permutation importance on the titanic dataset using. The permutation importance approach is \"model agnostic\" and defines feature importance as the decrease in performance when a single feature value is randomly shuffled. We will show that the impurity-based feature importance can inflate the importance of numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the impurity-based feature importance of random forests suffers from being computed on statistics derived from the training dataset: the importances can be high even for features that are not predictive of the target variable, as long as the model has the capacity to use them to overfit.\n",
