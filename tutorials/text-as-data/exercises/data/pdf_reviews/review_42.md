Review:

A perfectly nice grocery store with some upscale options like fine tea, olive oil, chocolates etc. However it irritates me how they are always lacking in produce.  

I can't say that I would make this a big shopping destination, if I lived here.   I would want more free range meats et al. (I'm from California, what can I say.)

Service always has a smile...  that IS a nice thing.

Plenty of parking, with a drug store and a liquor store (ABC) in the same location.  Handy since you can't buy hard liquor in the grocery store or on Sundays out here.  (meh)
