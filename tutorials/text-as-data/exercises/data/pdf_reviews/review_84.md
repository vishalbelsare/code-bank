Review:

Dr. B and her staff are amazing with all of my families dogs, cats and bunnies we have.  We actually travel about 40 minutes now from NW Las Vegas to use her services over other vets that are right down the street because how good her and her staff are to our pets. We also like her because her and her staff have big hearts for animals and you can tell they are animal lovers too! They are open on Saturdays too which is a big plus for people who work M-F.
