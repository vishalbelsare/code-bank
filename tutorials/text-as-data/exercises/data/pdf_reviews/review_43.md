Review:

Service was really good... nice little quick serve location.

But my carnitas was a bit on the bland side.  When I think Mexican, I drool over big bold flavours.  This was anything but.. if I could describe it.. I'd say this was as vanilla a taco as you could get.

If you don't like spicy food, or have been hiding under a rock and have never tried Mexican before and worried flavour in general, then this could be a start?

Unfortunately, there isn't a great Mexican place anywhere nearby.
