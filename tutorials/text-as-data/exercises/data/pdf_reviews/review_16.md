Review:

After much research I decided to trust my eyebrows to Eye Love. Meghan is incredible. I had brought in a few photos for reference of what I wanted my brows to look like (Miranda Kerr's). We compared her eyebrows to mine and while I held a mirror up, she showed me what she would do to create the shape I was after. 

When she was done I couldn't believe it, even though she took away hair.. my eyebrows looked so much more thick and lush. and this was before any shading. Magic i tell you. She then used some powder to complete them and showed me how to do the same at home. Not a hair is out of place. I am super picky but she is clearly super detail oriented!

Meghan is cool and down to earth, she didn't complain about my coffee breath and also has awesome style (bonus points++).

Can't wait to be back!
