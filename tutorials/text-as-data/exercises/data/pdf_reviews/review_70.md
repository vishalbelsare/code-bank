Review:

I make it a point to stop in at least once when I am in Las Vegas . . . since we frequent the Golden Nugget.  And up until this visit . . . I would say a solid four star establishment . . . this time . . . I was so disappointed that I only stopped in once.

The sushi . . . thought presented well . . . seemed to lack the flavors that I have gotten in the past . . . and in the crap and lobster rolls . . . we found pieces of shell.  We also ordered a hot plate this trip . . . the teriyaki chicken . . . and the sauce was like water and lacked any teriyaki flavor.

Will I be back . . . not sure . . . I know I will return to the Golden Nugget . . . but only time will tell if I return for sushi.
