Review:

I have been to Gen before but at a different location. And I have to admit the price for lunch is 16.99 is such a steal! And this location is very clean and the staff is very attentive. The food is decent and fresh. However a bit of a tip... don't leave the sides out bring them out when the customer arrives and play Korean music!!! Others than that, I suggest this Korean BBQ to everyone and it's huge so bring the family!
