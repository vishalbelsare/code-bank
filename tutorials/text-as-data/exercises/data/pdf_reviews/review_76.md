Review:

We were staying at GVR and were recommended to check out Rachel's Kitchen by a friend. Let me just say we went back the next 2 days for breakfast every day of our stay! Loved everything we tried on the breakfast menu as well as the daily special Huevos Rancheros - we weren't disappointed!! Also love the free mimosa when you check in on yelp and the patio seating enjoying the lovely weather! Can't get enough!
