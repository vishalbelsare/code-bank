Review:

Finally got to try out Pai! Super late review tho, oops. I came by party of 4 on a Sat afternoon to grab lunch. A lot of people told me it gets really busy and it did looked a little packed but wasn't too bad. Lively and upbeat place! Didn't have to wait long maybe like 6 mins. Got seated on one of the high tables on the side near the low cushioned seats. Spacious enough for 4 people. 
I ordered the khao soi and this was good but it was a little on the cool side imo. My friend also said the same for his bowl as well. Was creamy and brothy. They were generous with my chicken protein. 
The pad thai was prob one of the best I've tried. 

I really enjoyed the thai iced tea. I've been craving for one ever since!
As an app to share, we ordered the garbong? Don't know if I spent this right but it's basically squash fritters. Tastes like sweet potato fries to me but this was really good and I would order this again. The sauce that came with it was a perfect match.

I would come back again!
