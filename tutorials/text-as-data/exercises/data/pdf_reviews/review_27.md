Review:

I probably should have studied up a little more on this place before deciding 8 o clock on a friday as a good meeting time.  Yeah, not the best time to go.  I'd been there around normal bar hours before, but totally forgot about the whole "restaurant" aspect of the place.

The time we went is kind of the odd in between time of people going to eat dinner and people still there for happy hour, so it was pretty packed.  There were several groups of people waiting for tables to eat when we got there.  Good thing we were invited to try to find a seat on the bar.   *Try* being the operative word.  It's a huge bar in the middle of the floor, with seating on 3 sides, but there weren't any seats at all.  Hmm. 

So, my friend and I got to enjoyed our first brewery crafted treat standing in between a few tables, with the seated patrons kinda checking the two of us out like, "dumbass... didn't you realize it'd be this full?"  *shrug*

Thankfully, after about 15 minutes a couple seats at the bar opened up.  Hooray!  

I suggest the Oatmeal Stout, Kiltlifter and Hefeweizen.  All are really good, and priced nicely at less than $4.  How cool is that?

Warning- parking here isn't the best.  You probably will be parking on the street and you probably will have to walk a block or two.  Don't be all shocked by this.  In fact, if your walk is less than 5 minutes, you did well.
