Review:

Okay I took my daughter who is 12 here after calling first. She had got her nails done elsewhere and were not done well she was rushed because she was young. 

Fixed my daughters nails!
Wow Award Nails did such a great job. My daughter even shortened them so she can play the guitar. They tapered and fixed the crooked one from the last salon and took there time and thinned them. We only waited 10min before she sat down. I did have to get someone's attention and told them we called. They were great!  Took her right back and she wasn't treated differently because she was young!  She picked army green and gold glitter on her ring finger and they turned out great and the shape was on point!!. I will post the nails they fixed they were a blue bulky thick square and not what I wanted for her.
