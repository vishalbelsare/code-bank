Review:

I can't express how happy I am with HENDERSON NISSAN.
I gone in for 2 recalls and also mentioned that I had car issues with my engine and the wonderful rep JAMES HAYS is.--the reasons why.
I came in on the first two recalls for my 2009 NISSAN ROUGE and I got into a NISSAN rental and everything happened accordingly and I got my car back in 3 days.
I went back this week due to my transmission going and James was so sweet and concerned helpful!
I was so pleased that  "HE HAD THE COURAGE TO DO THE RIGHT THING" as to helping me with my car and we even has a personal conversation about traveling and making sure that I would be safe on the road. I had no idea I even had my warranty on my car. I felt at ease with James and reassured me that he made a 2nd rental reservation and he did.
I went in and dropped my car off and I know that I won't see my car for a few days but the service was just on POINT. I work for a call center and I always want to appreciate great customer service.
I want to say JAMES HAYS , thank you for being you and being a great person that you are so far with my car issues. I cant stress this enough because I deal with customer service daily in my job and I appreciate you!!!
Keep doing what you are doing and get promoted or a raise!
