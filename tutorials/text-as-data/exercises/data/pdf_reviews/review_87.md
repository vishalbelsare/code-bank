Review:

If you are a Hilton Honors Member, do not expect Hilton Honors treatment. I decided to stay here as an HHonors member and was treated very poorly. The front desk refused to bring up waters to my my room and the valet also refused to get my car ready for departure. I complained to Hilton Worldwide who forwarded me to Hilton Grand Vacations, I am assuming Grand Vacations as no responsibility to Hilton Worldwide in keeping guests happy. The response from Thomas MacGregor was uncaring and unaccomodating. At least staying at one of the other fine resorts in Las Vegas will get you great service not to mention a better location on the strip. My advice.... stay at one of the other nice resorts, this one is terrible. Especially if you need something other than a room to sleep in.
