Review:

Nothing special. Just another dispensary. The hours are much better than others i will give them that. I came here on a Saturday and wanted to buy the relief medicine for my dog but there wasnt enough staff. I just stood there for a few minutes and was like fuck it and left. And whats up with the cops staking out the parking lot? Shits awkward. Medizin is still my favorite place in vegas.
