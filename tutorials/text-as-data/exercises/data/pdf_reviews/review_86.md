Review:

MY FIRST and LAST VISIT HERE! Myself and 7 other people stayed at the elara this past weekend for my 21st bday. When we arrived to our 2bedroom suite we fell in love with the amenities and views that we had. My boyfriend and cousin had stayed in a similar suite when it was the PH towers. We also liked that it was so close to the planet hollywood casino and attached to the miracle mile shops. 



Where it all went wrong, our 2nd night at the hotel we were getting ready and had music on, apparently the music was to loud because we had security ( Anthony ) come up and give us our first strike in a rude manner. Seriously we are in vegas and we were using their stereo system maybe they should remove that or adjust to what volume we were able to use.( we didn't have it on max)


 3rd day we called the front desk that we could hear a smoke detecter going off in one of the rooms next to us, they said they would send someone up. We could still hear it a couple hours later. When we came back from our night out we noticed a horrible smell coming from the room next to us. It smelled like a dead animal very unusual and disturbing smell. Two of our guest went to the front desk to tell someone about it. While they went down we had 2 security guards (Samantha) knock on our door and say that there is loud music and we explained there's no music on, then she said loud voices that this was the second strike and all non registered guest will have to leave.  Both security came in the suite and told us who can stay and everyone else had 10mins to gather our stuff and leave. We tried to explain that we had someone down stairs complaining about the smell in the hall way and she just kept saying they were sending someone up for us to start gathering our stuff. At that point I had to wake up my boyfriend and we started getting our stuff together. The room was under my cousins name and while he was at the front desk he was even getting a later check out time, when he came back up and found out what was happening he couldn't believe that some of us had to leave. As we tried to explain stuff to security they would just be rude and tell us we all need to leave now!
