Review:

I like it, I'm usually a harsh critique to food, but come on guys! this place's seafood was amazing, I had the sea food platter, the lobster was so sweet and delicious and fresh! 

the soup was great too! 

This is definitely the better CN Tower rotating restaurant between this location and Niagara location. 

I highly recommend it if you are looking for a classy date place. 

the only down was that large groups are way too loud, if you were seated around them, you are shit out of luck. like me. unfortunately. but the atmosphere was still amazing once i mastered to block their sounds and enjoy the food.
