Review:

This place is great for kids to come have a day of fun, but it wasn't so great for my daughter's birthday party. This review is for birthday service.

I read other similar birthday party reviews after the party.

We arrived early in hopes of being able to get organized before guests arrived. We waited in line upon arrival to check in and sign waivers for each family member when the reserved time had already started. I understand that Rockin Jump will say I could've done this online prior to arrival, but I also had difficulty booking online and with their Web site. That's another problem I had. 

We handed off the cake, balloons, and goody bags to the staff at the front check-in desk. They also took a birthday card with money and stuck it in a drawer for later. All guests were standing around wandering what to do or where to go, and I had never been there before. All the birthday rooms were being used during our time, and the place was packed. There was no where for guests to sit down. I was very embarrassed.

A hostess came over and introduced herself. She told us that that the kids were supposed to be jumping. She told us that everyone needed to place their personal belongings together in one big rolling basket that is divided into two compartments. One for gifts and one for shoes, purses, socks, jackets, etc.... I did not like this. I looked like a big laundry basket with people's belongings and gifts.

No one showed us around. We were left on our own. All guests and parents split up to go play.

Kids in the party were thirsty after jumping around and couldn't find a water fountain.
When the room was finally ready and they called our party over. The room had not been decorated with the balloons I had brought. People were sitting around waiting and watching the room get set up.  There was no ice for the drinks. I asked the hostess for ice and she brought two small bowls with ice with no ice scoop.

When I had previously called and ordered the pizzas and drinks. Rockin Jump had advised that all food has to be preordered days before the party. I do not like this because, not all guests show up at times, or sometimes more guests show up than expected. I didn't feel comfortable knowing that people would be leaving hungry because I had run out of food, or that I would have to overpay for pizza that would not be eaten. (The food, drinks, and snacks are expensive)

Anyway, the pizzas were from Marco's Pizza. When I opened up the boxes, they were hard, old, and it seemed like they had been delivered some time back. The pizza was horrible.
By the time guests ate the old pizza and had cake, they felt rushed to go jump. I didn't feel my daughter got to enjoy time with her friends on her birthday because of the chaos, the disorganization, and time pressure. The gifts were not introduced into the birthday party. They were left in the laundry basket. 

At check out, the Manager asked how everything was. I started to tell her, and she acted like she didn't care, ignored me, and proceeded to check me out without a response. In addition, the party helper gets a gratuity, which I gave her one because I didn't know who was really responsible for the bad party and she did help my husband load up the gifts from the laundry basket outside. While leaving, one of the guests asked if birthday girl had received her birthday card. Staff had to look for it up front in the drawers, but luckily it was found. If I wouldn't have asked, we wouldn't have received it. (like the ice and balloons)

This place disappointed me with their birthday services.
