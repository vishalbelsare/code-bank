Review:

So so good! My husband and I visited this food truck during the FoodStock. We waited about 45 minutes in line (worth it) and got this hot buttered lobster roll, the traditional (my fav) and the lobster bisque. The bisque was a little too heavy/salty for us but we were a fan of the rolls. We appreciate that this is a family run operation, orders were taken by the Maine Lobster Lady's daughter! And even though it was 8 pm, they had been serving since 4 pm, they didn't run out of food. Can't wait for them to come back next season!
