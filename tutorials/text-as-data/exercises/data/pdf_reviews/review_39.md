Review:

Absolutely horrible!
Authentic italian? Really?
I would like to have two words with owner claiming that!
We ordered 5 different plates incl pizza and they were all bad.
First,pizzas crust was just bad, even my wife when she is in hurry can make it 10x better.
Ingredients were tasteless but bigest surprise is - OIL !
Why pizza is so oily ? I provided you with picture of plate full of oil?
Never seen that in my life! And i grow up in Nothern Italy.
If you serve pizza in this way somewhere in Itally customer would call Carabinieri!
This was the first time seeing my 5 year old daughter saying she does not like (and will not eat) pizza!
Mediterranean clams were bad too,just tasteless , and of all 5 plates we ordered only thing we liked was -  fried calamary.
Comparing other italian placer here in LV this was by far worst one
