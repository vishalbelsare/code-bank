Review:

I've been here twice after people kept recommending it to me as really authentic AND delicious.

I highly recommend getting the La Gourmandise pastry which has vanilla cream and scattered chocolate bits for those of you who think the usual pan au chocolat (the chocolate croissant essentially) doesn't have enough chocolate.

They have gigantic macarons with fresh macarons and some sort of cream. GIANT macarons. Seriously. Forgo the birthday cake and just get that.

Their quiches actually look really good too, and seem very popular with locals.

I believe another popular choice are the almond croissants but I've yet to try them!

The service here is great, they're very patient, and occasionally they have samples in store!
