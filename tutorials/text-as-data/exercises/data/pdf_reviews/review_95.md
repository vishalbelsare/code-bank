Review:

I'm extremely picky when it comes to finding a good nail salon. I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out. 

I wanted a gel manicure done and they are pretty reasonably priced. I wanted a palm tree done on two fingers and I think my nail tech had a hard time doing it so he gets an A for effort. Lol. ( see picture) 

I was pretty satisfied when I left. However it's been two days since I got my nails done and the polish is already chipping. ( see before and after picture)  I'm definitely going back to address this issue. I would've given a 2 star but the guy gets an extra star for his attempt at my design.
