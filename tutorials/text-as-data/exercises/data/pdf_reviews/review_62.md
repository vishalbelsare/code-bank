Review:

Stopped in here for a manicure before I headed out of the country for vacation and had one of the worst manicures ever. There were hardly any colors of polish to chose from. The nail tech (I believe her name was Colleen) actually added some thinner to the polish because it was too thick. I left with lumpy polish that bubbled. Even my husband noticed how bad my nails looked. Sadly disappointing. I chose this place because it has good reviews on Yelp and it was close to my office.
