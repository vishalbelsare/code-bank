Review:

This was the first time we had to board our dog, he is only 10 months old.  I was nervous about it at first, but he seemed to take to it right away.  The staff was nice, helpful, and very accommodating.  When they took him back to the kennel when we first arrived, he went very willingly.  When I called for updates, the staff answered all my questions and let me know he was doing well.  When we got home and picked him up he seemed fine!  I think he enjoyed himself.  My other experience with dog-boarding has been less then stellar.  Usually the dogs are mad or aloof, but he seemed absolutely fine!  A+++
