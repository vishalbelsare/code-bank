Review:

Gail Knits is located in a strip mall in the shi-shi neighborhood of Summerlin. The mentality of the neighborhood definitely permeates the attitude inside the store. When you walk through the door (if you can find it) you are usually greeted with the baleful glare of two or three older women sitting around a fold out table. Sometimes their knitting, sometimes they're just chatting. Either way, if you're not a regular customer, you are obviously rudely interrupting whatever it is they're doing. 

The yarn selection is nice, and the store is organized fairly well. There are swatches knitted up to show how some of the yarns will look, but mostly it's just cubby holes full of extremely expensive yarn. There are some mid range yarns priced a little higher than I've seen other places, but when you consider the mark up of just about anything in Las Vegas it's to be expected. 

The store is small, and the employee(s) are not generally too thrilled to just let you wander the stacks. One of two things will happen, they will hover until you just grab nearest hank and head for register, or should you ask for help in selecting an appropriate yarn, they will steer you towards the most expensive choice completely disregarding any mid range choices. Even if you ask. 

They do offer to ball your yarn for you, but if you get your yarn balled they will not accept it back if you try to return it.  

My main complaint about this store overall is that they turn their noses up at anyone who might use their yarn for something other than straight knitting. When I brought in a crochet pattern and asked for help selecting a yarn substitution, I was literally cold shouldered and told that it would be easier for me to find yarn for the project at big box craft store, Michaels. 

Overall, the selection is nice, but overpriced. The help is about as unhelpful as you can get and still consider it 'customer service'. If you are looking for a local yarn shop that is elitist than Gail Knits is the one for you.
