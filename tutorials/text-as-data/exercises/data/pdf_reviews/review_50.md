Review:

Welcome here a lot... I'm always super confused as to why there are literally ten employees standing around the registers chatting each and every time we enter the store. Odd. They never ask if they can help you find anything or give you anything more than a obligatory "hello."

 Last time we came in they briefly acknowledged us. We forgot something in the car, came right back in, and they acknowledged us again as if they hadn't seen us 5 minutes prior. 

When you do need help, someone will assist, but some.. especially the women, seem bothered.

The last time we came in the two most helpful people were two guys loading pallets. 

That being said, there are always a few staff actually working... it's the ten up front chatting that are frustrating.

I'd say the prices are good and the selection is good. We will definitely be back for more materials, but they staff aren't a selling feature for this location.
