Review:

Overall an interesting meal. Wanted to rate this higher, but there were some hiccups here (more to follow...).  

My wife and I are both foodies. We go out at least one time a week with the kids, and at least one time a month as a couple to higher end restaurants. So across our experiences we both agree that first of all - the food was great! 

Really fresh ingredients, creative execution, interesting dishes - exactly what you would expect from Payton Curry, one of the most creative talents in the Valley. The wine list - superb! We found many favorite varietals and also had some very good wines from all over the world: Croatian reds, Spanish, Argentine, German and solid French and Napa selections. Our meal was excellent.

Now, several reviews here complain on price - this is silly. This is a nice restaurant, not casual dining. Cafe Boa is on par with nice Phoenix and Scottsdale restaurants. A little pricey for college students? Yeah, maybe, but really no different than House of Tricks down the street. Entrees ranged from $16 - 20 for pasta dishes and $20 - $30 for meat/grilled Mains. Perfectly moderate pricing for a nicer restaurant in AZ.

Now the mixed part: something was really off on service. We literally had to wait almost an hour for our appetizers, salads and bread. A real stress. The whole waitstaff just seemed off. When we spoke up assurances came - food didn't. We finally got attention from the manager, who was incredibly gracious and apologetic - really kind, understanding and top-notch response. She explained that the huge rush this weekend with PF Changs had thrown them for a loop. To be fair, others around us didn't seem to suffer the same lag in service - we were just the unlucky table for the evening, whose ticket kept getting missed. A little odd, yes, but she really went beyond expectations to make us feel better - She comped most all of our really excellent food/wine. Incredibly generous, and well beyond what any restaurant would do to make good!

Would I recommend Cafe Boa? Yes, on food alone, fantastic. Could not be any more pleased. Service, well, it could be a challenge - so don't expect a quick meal, but then again fine dining should be a experience, not a rush. Just have another wine and enjoy your leisurely date. And hopefully nothing goes wrong with the waitstaff/kitchen dynamic. I would be surprised if your luck was as poor as ours - and I can't imagine such a graciously generous response as we had from the manager. She was incredibly nice. The great food and response to our problems were highly professional and appreciated. This is a top notch place!
