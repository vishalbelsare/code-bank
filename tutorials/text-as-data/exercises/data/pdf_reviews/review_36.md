Review:

I guess I was expecting more. If you go to their website, you will get a site for Lenny's Burgers that is NOT associated with this location. So you may be misled. 

This place is a small (seats 8 along the window) snack stand. Similar to the snack bars at sporting events. They had 2 picnic tables outside.The day we went there it was smokey from the exhaust fan not working well. It was hot and greasy and claustraphobic inside. In 2 seconds we agreed to make this a take out order. 

On the plus side, the burgers were good but you have to pay for each topping except condiments, lettuce and tomato. The lettuce was sparcely distributed. My wife had a chicken salad that I could have made at home.
