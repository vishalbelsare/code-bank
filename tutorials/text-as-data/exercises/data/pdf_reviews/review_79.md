Review:

my second time here and no regrets! Took a party of 13 during valentines weekend. Everyone had a great time and treated to great food. Large menu that appealed to everyone. I had the steak cobb salad again which is amazing and very reasonably priced. Others had salmon, prime rib, ribs, parmesean steak and more. Kind of reminds me of cheesecake factory but in a nicer setting. Prices about same or less.  Bar is sooooo gorgeous with upscale scottsdale feel. Highly recommend this place!
