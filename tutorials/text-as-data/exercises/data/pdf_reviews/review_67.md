Review:

For my second visit, we started off with the cheese curds which quickly arrived. The balance of breading to cheese seemed about perfect to me though if you like heavy breading, these may not be for you. For the main course I ordered the chicken piccata. It came too early into the appetizer and it was topped with scads of capers and garlic, which at first glance looked like too much stuff. I quickly changed my mind once I tore into the dish. Wonderful tangy lemony briney salty flavor. I happen to love salt, a lot, so if you were on a restricted sodium diet, this dish might be too much for you. The chicken came on a small bed of sliced potatoes, which were satisfactory - clearly they weren't meant to be the star of the dish. The only food misfire was the side of broccoli rabe. It had a brutal acrid taste of what I imagine cigarette ash might be like. Very odd but my dinner companion wholeheartedly agreed with this assessment. They kindly offered a replacement of simply steamed broccoli rabe but it was some of the most bitter veggies I've ever had. My only other big complaint was the ridiculous level of noise. A restaurant with food and drinks this good  and a place sporting a nice friendly neighborhood bar vibe does not really need TVs everywhere. I will make sure I don't go back when there is a big sports game going on that will be televised.
