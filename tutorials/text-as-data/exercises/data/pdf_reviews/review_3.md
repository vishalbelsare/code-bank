Review:

Was introduced to this restaurant by my daughter, who frequents this place occasionally for dinner. Since then, my family comes here every so often.
The ambiance is contemporary Korean. Eat all you can order meats and then you cook it yourself in the grill to your liking. Sides, rice and or noodles and some gyozas are available to whet the appetite.
Servers and bussers were friendly and attentive to all the orders and very efficient as well as friendly. A nice place to hang around with friends and family as you can stir up conversations and interactive cooking/grilling on the table itself. 
Price is reasonable and a definite recommend, guaranteed to fill up. All you need to bring is your appetite! 

A must visit place.
