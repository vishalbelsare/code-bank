Review:

I wish I could give this place a zero star. Horrible service, waited for 30 minutes and no one came to serve us. I had to ask someone to bring us a waiter. The waiter was rude and basically did not know what she was doing. 

The food was absolutely disgusting and over salty, I felt like my sodium level went from 0-100. I wish this place closes down or the management can contact me directly cause I really want to know what made them think this is acceptable. I am sure McDonald's has better service than this zero star trash. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO VISIT TO PLACE. I honestly would rather give a homeless person $70 than paying for food there. 

If anyone tells you this place has good food they are lying or they work there. 

Smh, horrible, disgusting.
