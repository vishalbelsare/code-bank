Review:

This was our first visit to GRT for dinner, and the experience was a good one.  It's a fairly large unassuming space, with lots of HDTV's, a large bar, and a spacious dining area with open tables.  We went with friends (party of 5 including 2 kids), and everyone was happy.  Especially tasty was the shrimp and lobster tacos, and their cheese pizza.  The pizza was truly excellent, with the cheese browned a bit, which added greatly to the flavor and texture.  My only gripe about the food is that I wish they offered the tacos on a soft pita bread or tortilla shell, instead of the iceberg lettuce shells.  The lettuce shells detracted a bit from the great taste of the shrimp and lobster, and made that dish taste a bit like a seafood salad, rather than a taco.  I also thought they were a bit pricey too.  Nonetheless, our server was very accomodating and professional, and that alone is why patrons may choose a place over another, all things being equal.  Parking is a bit challenging, as there are limited spaces available within a small strip mall.  We will return.
