Review:

This place has gone down like a sinking ship the food quality is horrible except a select few items. I had the black bean burger with avocado it was great . My wife had the cajun shrimp pasta it was good . The appetizers were horrendous the bacon nachos they served us had stale chips tasted like the Morton salt factory and cheese and probably undercooked bacon didnt look done . The chicken quesadilla had 2 slithers of onion no pico on the side nothing . Service is ok here friendly staff but slipping on the basics like napkins on the table wowww 4 napkins for 2 people with the endless app deal . I should say the endless slop deal Im a big food person and I have been cooking since I was 9 and this is the worse of any of the corporate restaurants Ive seen. The burgers are all good so if you eat here play it safe folks I better get my Donagel ready now!!!
