Review:

Usually coming here is fine, similar to any other dispensary nothing special. However, tonight I went at around 1a.m. and had to use the drive thru as a result and the guy at the window was so mean. He was an elderly guy with a gray beard who would interrupt everything my husband would say as he tried to order and when we told him what we wanted he was like "um sure if we even have that" which left me taken aback. Then when my husband asked him for the military discount he said "I need your military id"-but my husband had given him his military id already as the main form of id when he asked for one and then told my husband it wasn't valid because it apparently wasn't what he was used to. Every other time we have come here prior they have given my husband a military discount without even having to ask. You can't be a bud tender and condescending to your customers, it beyond ruined the atmosphere of this place. If you have time come here, make sure it's during the day so you can avoid the asshole budtenders or just head to any of the other shops close to the strip.
