Review:

The W of Studio M & W is Stefan W which stands for ... Wonderful! He brought his coiffeur craft over from Charleville in France - a town famous for its puppetry festival, which I worked at a few months ago. He's also a bit of a perfume connoisseur so we had a lot of puppet-and-perfume-related chat and I got some great tips on places to go to sniff interesting things. 

I'm not from Montreal so I took a circuitous route to find the salon and happened to end up in the midst of riot police, burning barricades and protesters outside the Palais de Congres on my way there. The fact that this did not even come up in conversation I think says something about the calm atmosphere that prevails at Studio M & W!

Nice salon touches include: 
- a very stylish knee-length black robe with pleated tie belt (worn underneath the clipping-catcher longer robe)
- choice of fizzy or still water ...
- ... which came on a platter cocoa-sprinkled with the stencilled monogram of the salon - fancy!

And the cut? He expertly and precisely interpreted my need for an updating of my assymetric style into something "un peu plus boheme, un peu plus exager√©" which is exactly what I got. And the proof of the pudding - my hair was admired by strangers not once but twice during my walk back to my flat!
