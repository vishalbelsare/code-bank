Review:

I cannot say enough about my wonderful experience with this company. Vince shot my wedding and I specifically sought him out to shoot my vow renewal as well. 
He took all the time I needed to get the perfect photo, offered his expertise and allowed for my ideas to flow through as well. It was an awesome experience and we had a great time during the process. He can immediately put a nervous bride and groom at ease.

Great experience, I'd give 10 stars if I could! New Romantix all day long!
