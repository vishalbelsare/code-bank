Review:

We hosted a family reunion/birthday party here. I live out of state and organized the entire event via phone and email. Michelle, events coordinator, was fantastic to work with.  The event was perfect, food delicious and the adult pi√±ata was a blast. I highly recommend Aunt Chilada's. They made it all so easy!
