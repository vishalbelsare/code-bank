Review:

Was here for the New Years Eve count down and found the event to be just Meh. The open bar although open didnt have much in terms of selection and things that were considered premium liqour and therefore actually cost full price, was average in my book. A little overpriced and a little over-hyped, but overall, average. Definitely would try something else for New Years next time. 3 stars.
