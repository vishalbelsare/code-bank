Review:

We love this place. G&B has a really great vibe and pleasant atmosphere on Monroe Street. Our food has been uniformly excellent, though some may balk at the unusual menu. Service is cheerful and prompt.

Parking can a challenge, but if it's too inconvenient, you can always go to the mall. A short walk won't kill you.
