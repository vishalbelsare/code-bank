Review:

Visiting Toronto and I bookmarked this place so long ago seeing all the reviews and all. 

Entered the place and thought wow it's so cute! Waited 25 mins got seated and figured out that the khao sai was sold out with chicken and beef just tofu and shrimp :))))))) went for shrimp. It was good! The curry was delicious. Everything else fell real short. Papaya salad- below average. My mother who isn't Thai makes better Papaya salad. Pad Thai- eh I've had better in LA. The rice plate was ok.

It was snowing, and I didn't realize that you can't park upfront without a permit. Got a parking ticket :))) In conclusion, this was an average thai joint for me on the high end in my wallet(with the ticket)
