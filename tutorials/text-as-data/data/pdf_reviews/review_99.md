Review:

Well, I love this place let's just start there shall we? I'm so glad I found Green New shortly after moving to AZ because it is certainly full of options. We started with the buffalo wings, not my fave (it's a texture thing) but my gf loved it. The samosas were a bit greasy for my liking but the Big Wac made up for that! Man, that is a good sandwich. Back in the day when I ate meat and loved Mcdonalds that was my jam and now here we are in veggie land just as dee-lish! I come here just for this sandwich. Staff is always helpful and friendly and I love going next door for vegan desserts after. Love this place.
