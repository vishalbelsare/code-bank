Review:

We eat here all the time.
And i mean...ALL THE TIME. 

Is it because I love their menu? No, not really, it's because my boyfriend is hooked on pho this winter and can't stop taking us out for a cheap, hearty dish that's around the corner and, let's be honest here, probably one of the better Pho places in Willowdale that hasn't totally pissed us off with bad service (sorry Vietnamese Delight, my boyfriend will always stink eye you forever).

That being said, the rare beef pho with fresh noodle never dissapoints (i hate the vermicelli/thin rice noodle, I grew up with pho with thick fresh rice noodles). The cuts of beef are perfect and have no freezer burn (cough, Pho Hung) and the broth at the willowdale location is definitely alot better than the one on Spadina.

Cheap, consistent quality, decent service - this place will continue to get our service for a long time.
