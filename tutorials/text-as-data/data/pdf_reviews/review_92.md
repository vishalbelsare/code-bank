Review:

Wow, this place smells Amazing! Great staff! Fresh salad and awesome ribs! The time we waited for our food was reasonable. The place was clean...did I say it smells Amazing?! Next door is also a neat little gift shop if you are into that.
I actually asked the gals in my swimming class for a place and they mentioned big chains including Tony Romas--but they weren't sure if that was still around. I can hardly wait to go back and tell them the great experience we had here today! 1/2rack of ribs were to die for!
