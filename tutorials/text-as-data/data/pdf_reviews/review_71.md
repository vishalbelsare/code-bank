Review:

We had our wedding ceremony at this hotel. Overall the experience was good. Silke hunt, our coordinator, was very sweet. She communicated with us clearly and frequently. Our bouquets and boutenneires were beautiful and the chapel was gorgeous. The only complaint I have is about the photographer. He didn't silence his phone for the ceremony and it went off right in the middle of it. He also wasn't very directive. This was the first time we've ever had photography done and he didn't give us very much direction, so it was kind of awkward the whole time. It was basically "turn your head like this, be happy, act like you like your spouse, stand here". He came off super snarky and impersonable and I was told by several people he liked to roll his eyes about things. I don't remember his name but I'm going to try to find out and update this post. The pictures were pretty but they didn't blow me out of the water. But i had to purchase them to have any solid memeory of our ceremony. It's too bad they don't allow you to hire your own photographer, I could have paid my best friend/bridesmaid less and she would have had been a better photographer.
