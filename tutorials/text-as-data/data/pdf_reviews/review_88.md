Review:

Working with Jab from Life in Vegas was amazing from start to finish. Every time I reached out to Jab he responded right away- we were coming from out of state and he was able to provide us with tons of great suggestions and even transportation to the various spots of our session! 
Jab was on time, professional and most importantly personable- by the end of the day he felt like an old friend.  We have never had photo shoot before and he made us feel comfortable and we were able to have fun with it. I'm so happy with the outcome of our photos and the quick delivery as well. I honestly couldn't recommend him enough.
