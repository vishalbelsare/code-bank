Review:

Located in The Artisan Boutique Hotel. Don't let the name fool you. The pool itself is the size of a shot glass, and it is crammed into a small lot. The only thing big here is the attitude of the staff. No ice water? WTF? $6 for a bottle of water? WTF? This is a clear case of a place forgetting what it is vs. what it pretends to be. This is a property that is trying to change its well earned image as the place you would never want to be caught dead in to a somewhat respectable property. My little rant aside its still a pretty cool place. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
