Review:

Don't ever call south Phoenix police if you're hurt or need them! I was in a car accident and literally sat in the middle of the road for over an hr 1/2 "bc they were busy" I've been sitting in my car watching about 4-5 Phoenix police officers drive by and not stop or help! Drive right past you! And these are our "heros." These are the "good guys" that are supposed to help you?!? Bullshit! Hire some better officers not ones that sit on their ass and drive around all day looking for a bum crossing the street instead of handling a real emergency!!! Piece of shit cops!
