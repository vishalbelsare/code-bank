Review:

Wonderful place!! We visited for our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful night. The food was out of this world and the wine selection a true delight with excellent back story to boot. The ambiance, although you may feel a bit of intimacy is lost due to ample seating, is of nice high-end comfort.
