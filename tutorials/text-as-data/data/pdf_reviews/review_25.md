Review:

Wandered past this place at Pacific mall today and was drawn in by their poster advertising cheese-y tamago rolls (scrambled egg roll) and I was not disappointed. 

I ordered the fish roe tamago roll as well as the "exploding cheese" Korean egg waffle and found that the egg was perfectly done for both orders.

The egg for the fish roe tamago roll had a super fluffy texture and contained bits of corn and cheese.  Once the roll was made, it was dressed with fish roe, sweet soy sauce, wasabi mayo, seaweed and bonito flakes.  As I usually prefer scrambled eggs, this was my favourite of the two. 

The poached egg within the Korean egg waffle on the other hand was beautifully runny and soaked into the butter pastry that it was encased in. While I am typically not a fan of kraft singles, it complimented the butter pastry well.

I will definitely be back to try their drinks next time!
