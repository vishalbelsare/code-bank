Review:

The staff here were nice & my server kept refills on my drink but along with the view there aren't many other positives. The food was just ok. I was convinced to buy the buffet of buffets so I had brunch here but if you are looking more for quality instead of quantity I wouldn't recommend this. Wynn had such a GREAT buffet that Paradise couldn't compete. I wanted to be wowed & delighted but this is just mass produced food.
