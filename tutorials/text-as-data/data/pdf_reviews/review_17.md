Review:

This tiny and quaint mom-and-pop's style breakfast place is easy to overlook, but served one of the nicest breakfasts I've had in a long time.  I had the Pancake combo with french toast instead and it was DELICIOUS.  The syrup tasted natural and the toast tasted homemade- fluffy and not greasy.  The bacon was perfect and the coffee was pretty nice too.  Wonderful service, attentive and so polite.  I wish I was a local so I could go there every weekend!  A perfect breakfast stop on the way home from Las Vegas.
