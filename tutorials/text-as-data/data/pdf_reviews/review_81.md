Review:

Not too be missed. Walking through the mall and decided to stop because they had a great jazz band playing outside. So glad we stopped. The owner treats you like you are long, lost family- she is so happy you are there and so welcoming.
Service was prompt, friendly and efficient. But, oh, the food. Everything is so fresh, high quality and tasty. Tastes as good as it looks.
But leave room for dessert-the not quite birthday cake with pistachio brittle is sublime. Bring enough people so you can have the churros, too.
