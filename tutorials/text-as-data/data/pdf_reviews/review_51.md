Review:

Fantastic. We tried them the week after they opened. Starting with chips the queso with chorizo - excellent.

I had the taco and enchilada, very fresh and tasty. Wife had fish tacos, shrimp and fish and I will get them next time. 

Kiddo had the quesadilla and loved it. Came with bowl of rice in a hard tortilla bowl as do the beans. Very clever. 

Locally owned an operated. This place is a gem.  Fresh reasonable Mexican with a full ball (full bar will be open soon with mixologist) - Can't wait to go back. 

Fresh, friendly, great service and very tasty!
