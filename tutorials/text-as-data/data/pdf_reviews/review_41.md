Review:

Horrible service and food.  Ordered pizza & wings for delivery.  Delivery was quick enough but food was terrible.  One quarter of the pizza was stuck to the lid of the box (box was crushed by some weight... possible the 2L pop bottle).  The fries that came with the wings were stone cold and I suspect were resting on the counter for some time.  When I wrote to their customer service (this was 2 weeks ago) there was never any replies.  Avoid yourself disappointment and a sorry stomach, find another place to order take out food.
