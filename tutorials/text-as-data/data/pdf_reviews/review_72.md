Review:

Oh the MILK MAN... and the sexy FIREMAN... You can lean you body on me any given nighT!! Haha. This is like burlesque, but with men. Men with chiseled abs, tight @ss, cute smile, and their sexy eyes... accent helps too!

I have to say I was taken by surprise. You would think this is one of those cheesy shows where to swing their schlongs in your face (unless you want them to!) Drinks was good. Entertainment was good. The pictures was hot, and damn the milk man got me all worked up... Firemen smooched me on the cheeks...

For those who are skeptical, give them a chance. :) It's Vegas. Live a little.
