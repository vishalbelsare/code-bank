Review:

I've gone to Brunsell several times over the years for a wide variety of projects (kitchen remodel, cedar deck).  I've found their staff to be courteous, helpful and possessing  deep knowledge of the product lines they carry.   On a recent order, I was even offered free delivery despite the small size of my mill work order.  You just can't get this kind of service at a big box store.
