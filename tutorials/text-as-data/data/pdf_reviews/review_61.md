Review:

I've been to this outlet mall twice now. On the upside, this is one of the nicer (if not the nicest?) in Charlotte and the surrounding areas. It looks clean; and the layout is pretty good...with great maps and directories to help you along.  

However, to be honest, I've never been a fan of this, or any other outlet. Though I have splurged on bargains in the past, the items found in this and other outlets I've ever been to is pretty much as expected...leftovers from retail stores. In short, not the shiniest or the snazziest finds...but usually dull, generic surplus items. 

Just yesterday, I checked out CHICO'S at this outlet, and the items in the store were nearly dreadful...as in Ugly. The worst selection I've ever seen from the Chicos' inventory...clearly the unwanted items. The service there was just as awful. Basically, the reps were fairly snippy in their greeting, and rather rude in their demeanor towards me. Almost made me not ever want to go to the real Chico's, even at South Park location. 

Actually, I did find (and try on) this semi-cute, yet flimsy, kimono wrap at LUCKY...but way overpriced ($59), even with their so-called 30% Off Special. I can find the same item for much less at the mall; and most definitely at places like ebay and Amazon. I will say, however, that every once in a while, you may "get lucky" and find something in these stores that may be super-cute. 

Still, from my little experience from outlets (which may be less than a dozen times in my whole life?), the selection that I've seen have been mostly dull. Sometimes, it's really not that big of a bargain either. Personally, I feel that you'll find much cuter items at a bargain from the malls near the end of each season...or sometimes, at random times. Despite the bad rap for high prices at malls, they do feature great, big sales...and often! Also, the stores themselves are MUCH cuter...but of course, that's a no brainer. I wasn't even inspired to take any pics of any stores while there.

On the more positive side, if you're looking to buy a designer watch or a bag for a bit less, outlet malls are a good idea (if you don't care to do a major search online for designer bargains, that is). Options are limited, and the items are dated, of course, but you're sure to find a steal of a deal.

SO...although I think this is better than most in the Charlotte and surrounding areas, it's still an outlet mall. Maybe I'm spoiled and/or picky, but again, am just not a fan of outlets. Think I'll stick with malls and boutiques.
