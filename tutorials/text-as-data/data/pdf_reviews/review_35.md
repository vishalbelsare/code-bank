Review:

Last Friday, I went to my first pool party at the SLS hotel.  Granted, I don't have anything to compare it to but I thought it was awesome!  The staff is friendly, the pool is nice and the DJ Thomas Gold was the best!!!  Clean bathrooms, nice towels and while they search your stuff pretty thoroughly at entry, from what I understand, the rules on the inside are pretty lax (you can keep your stuff right near the pool, etc)
