Review:

Ismael from EPP was terrific!  I was HORRIFIED reading these reviews - simply horrified. Our septic ejector pump sprung a leak at 6 a.m. and we contact our home warranty company (Fidelity National). They took forever to get us a name of a plumber to come out same day. Yup - I called and spoke to Mike and he gave us a window from 1 - 6 p.m., which is totally unacceptable. Just before 1 p.m., a Ismael called from EPP - what a pleasant guy!  He arrived well within 30 min. and by 1:50 p.m. our pump was fixed. He knew what he was doing and was so polite! (So glad it wasn't Mike! I had another plumber on call solely based on these reviews.) Ismael rocks!
