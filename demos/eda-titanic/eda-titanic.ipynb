    "In this demo, we will explore the likelihood of surviving the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The Titanic hit a iceberg in 1912 and quickly sank, killing 1,502 out of the 2,224 passengers and crew on board. One most important reason so many people died was that there were not enough lifeboats to serve everyone. Accordingly, it has also been frequently noted that the most **_likely_** people to survive the disaster were women, children, and members of the upper-class. Let's see if that is true.\n",

There are many other examples of the Titanic dataset in introductory statistics and Data Science courses, so we also encourage you to look around and see how others have approached the problem."

    "There are three basic options for loading and working with data in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pure `Python 3.x`\n",
    "  \n",
    "    In this approach, you load data directly into \"pure\" Python data objects, such as lists, sets, and dictionaries (or nested hiearchies of such objects, such as lists-within-lists, lists-within-dicts, dicts-within-dicts, and so on). Although operation on \"pure Python\" objects can be slow, it also is extremely flexible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * `NumPy`\n",
    "  \n",
    "    The basic data structures for holding arrays, vectors, and matrices of data are provided by a core package called `NumPy`. NumPy also has a set of linear algebra and numerical fuinctions, but in general such functions are now provided by another package called `scipy` (for scientific computing) and numerical computation is usually done there. `NumPy` has been optimized to run with primitive routines written in `C` (or even `fortran`) and so is orders-of-magnitude faster-running than doing calculations with pure Python. Nevertheless, the data access, subscripting, and slicing of elements for `NumPy` still conforms to the same syntax as pure Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * `pandas`\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Most applied Data Science projects (that fit into memory/RAM), now use an \"Excel-like\" package called `pandas`. Pandas stores data in objects called **dataframes**. Dataframes will become the central type of data object for your work in Data Science (much as Excel Spreadsheets often were for Business Analysts). Dataframes provide many different properties and methods that help you to work with your data more effectively. We will use `pandas` for most of the examples and problems in the class.   "

    "There are many ways to visualize data and results in Python. Sometimes that is a good thing - and sometimes it is a bad thing, for there are many ways to do it. Eventually you will want to learn multiple methods, as data scientists often use many different libraries. The following are the most common libraries, with links to their documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `pandas` https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "    If you are in a hurry, it also is possible to generate many simple plots directly from the `pandas` library and `dataframe` object. This is a good option when you are moving fast and all you need to so is see a simple histogram or trend line and you already have your data in a pandas dataframe.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `seaborn` https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Seaborn is a simplified and better looking interface that sits on top of the standard `matplotlib` library. Seaborn is often used because it looks great, but also gives you all the ability to go into `matplotlib` to customize graphs for a particular need.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `plotly` and `plotly_express` https://www.plotly.express/   \n",
    "  \n",
    "    The commercial package `plotly` is a comprehensive toolkit for building interactive, D3 and WebGL charts. Interactive graphs are particularly good for online (web-based) dashboards. As you can see in the plot of Python visualization options below, `plotly` is quickly rising in popularity. To use plotly, however, you need to sign up for a [plotly account](https://plot.ly/python/) and you need an active internet connection. We won't need all of the features in plotly, however, and so we will develop examples using just `plotly_express`. Plotly express is a free, local-to-your-machine, and easier-to-use, API to the plotly service. [See here for documentation](https://www.plotly.express/plotly_express/) for the plotly express API.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  * `matplotlib` and `pyplot` https://matplotlib.org/  \n",
    "  \n",
    "    Matplotlib is the core package for graphing in Python, and many other packages build on top of it (i.e., pyplot, pandas, and seaborn). The `matplotlib` object model can be somewhat confusing, which often means writing many lines of code and hours of debugging. To help, matplotlib also comes with an interface library called `pyplot` ([documentation here](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html)) that mimics the MatLab approach to graphing (helpful for many engineers). In general, however, `pyplot` has now been supplanted by the other options above. Although it is faster to get started with plotting by using one of the other options above, eventually you will find that you often need to return to matplotlib in order to \"tweak\" a layout or to work with more complicated graphs.
