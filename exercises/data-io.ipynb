    "In this exercise session, we will load data from a file, manipulate those data in Python and finally write it back to a file. These basic operations are important in any data science project. \n",

    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python package built for data analysis. It includes many useful functions, including one to read comma-separated (.csv) files. We will use this package as it's both easy to use and very powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need to import Pandas. As you will be learning (or already know), popular Python packages have common abbreviates. These abbreviations are used as a short-hand for that package throughout a Python script. Some of these common abbreviations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import pandas as pd`\n",
    "- `import numpy as np`\n",
    "- `import tensorflow as tf`\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we can call any function in the Pandas package as `pd.someFunction`. The `pd` keyword is reserved for Pandas and must not be used by any other variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, `import` statements are generally located at the top of a script, even though they might only be used at a later stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, do not hesitate to search the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) for help.\n"
